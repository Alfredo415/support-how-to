This article explains how to use a ticket template to add a new Microsoft&reg;
Active Directory user.

### Create a ticket in the MyRackspace portal

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace portal](https://login.rackspace.com/login) with
   your username and password.

5. Specify a username for the account you want to create.

   After the request completes, the system generates a secure password automatically for
   this user and provides it in the ticket. You can change this password later.

6. Specify a domain for the user.

   Check the box to grant the user administrative or sudo permissions. This automatically adds
   the user to Domain Administrator groups.

   Check the **Additional Instructions** box to provide additional information,
   such as user details or group membership permissions.

7. Select **Submit**.

   After the ticket generates, you see your ticket list in the MyRackspace Portal.
   It typically takes a few minutes for the ticket creation process to complete.
