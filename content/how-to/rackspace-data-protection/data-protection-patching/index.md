# Rackspace Data Protection Patching

In order to ensure the best quality of service, periodic patching of the Rackspace Data Protection infrastructure is required. Thankfully, patching does not require downtime and should be non-disruptive to normal backup and restore opportunities. During updates, nodes are taken down one at a time, with all operations failing over to other active nodes. Rackspace will notify users of maintenance windows due to the elevated risk for unanticipated impact, however updates are expected to be non-impacting.
